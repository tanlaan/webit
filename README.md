Little Minimalist Bookmarking Tool

## The little bookmarker that could

I decided to make this tool in order to have a super simple way to just slap some links into a markdown file and have it come out as a webpage that I can visit on my home server.

This requires the markdown2 package, but I hope to keep the requirements to a bare minimum.

## TODO

* Complete templatize function
* Clean up the argv portion to make sure you don't accidentally delete files you want or push files to some unknown folder
* Work out some way of ordering or organizing the bookmarks by generic categories
  * Maybe that will be what the first hashtag will be for
